# 4_20 Notes

## In the original ns2 project, we can implement token bucket in the diffserv folder. There is a policy named token bucket filter.
  *set qE1C [[$ns link $core $e2] queue]
  * Add entries in policy table
  $qE1C addPolicyEntry [$s1 id] [$dest id] TokenBucket 20 $cir0 $cbs0
  * Add Entries in policer table
  $qE1C addPolicerEntry TokenBucket 10 11
  *More examples under ~ns/tcl/ex/diffserv/


## Leaky bucket is just as simple as setting token = 1.

  * This provides the method we used in our project and implement multi flow based on token bucket.
